  "functionalVsClass_title": "1.- Functional Components vs. Class Components",
  "functionalVsClass_intro": "Functional components in React allow for a more modern approach to building components by using hooks for state and effects, which can lead to less verbose and clearer code.",
  "functionalVsClass_class": {
    "title": "Class Components",
    "description": "Traditionally, class components were the only option in React for managing state and lifecycle events, which could become bulky due to the need for explicit lifecycle methods like componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount, etc.",
    "inefficiency_example": "class ClassComponent extends React.Component {\n  constructor(props) {\n    super(props);\n    this.state = { counter: 0 };\n  }\n\n  increment = () => {\n    this.setState({ counter: this.state.counter + 1 });\n  }\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <button onClick={this.increment}>\n        Count: {this.state.counter}\n      </button>\n    );\n  }\n}"
  },
  "functionalVsClass_functional": {
    "title": "Functional Components with Hooks",
    "description": "Introduced in React 16.8, hooks allow functional components to manage state and side effects, making the code less verbose and more clear.",
    "efficiency_example": "function FunctionalComponent() {\n  const [counter, setCounter] = useState(0);\n\n  const increment = () => {\n    setCounter(counter + 1);\n  };\n\n  return (\n    <button onClick={increment}>\n      Count: {counter}\n    </button>\n  );\n}"
  },
  "reactMemo_usage": {
    "title": "Using React.memo",
    "description": "React.memo is a higher-order component that memorizes the output of a functional component. This means React will skip rendering the component if its props have not changed between renders, which is useful for avoiding unnecessary renders and enhancing performance.",
    "example_without_memo": "function ExpensiveComponent({ value }) {\n  console.log('Rendering expensive component');\n  return <div>Computed Value: {value * 2}</div>;\n}",
    "example_with_memo": "const MemoizedExpensiveComponent = React.memo(function ExpensiveComponent({ value }) {\n  console.log('Rendering only when value changes');\n  return <div>Computed Value: {value * 2}</div>;\n})"
  },
  "memo_practical_use": {
    "description": "React.memo is particularly useful in scenarios where a component has a high rendering cost, receives complex but rarely changing props, or is frequently re-rendered due to changes in the parent component that do not directly affect its props.",
    "inefficiency_consequences": "A heavy component that re-renders unnecessarily can cause lag or jank in the UI, especially noticeable on low-power devices or with large component trees."
  },
  "post2_conclusion": "By optimizing components with React.memo and preferring functional components over class components, not only do you improve rendering efficiency but also code readability and maintainability. This is crucial for large-scale projects where efficient state management and rendering can significantly impact performance and user experience.",
  "renderOptimization_title": "2.- Render Optimization",
  "renderOptimization_goal": "Ensure that components only re-render when necessary, thereby improving application efficiency.",
  "inefficientRendering_title": "Inefficiency: Uncontrolled Renderings",
  "inefficientRendering_problem": "In React, a component re-renders every time its state or props change, but also when the parent component re-renders, regardless of whether the props it receives have changed.",
  "inefficientCode_example": "function ParentComponent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n      <input value={text} onChange={e => setText(e.target.value)} />\n      <ChildComponent data={text} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ChildComponent({ data }) {\n  console.log('ChildComponent is rendering!');\n  return <p>{data}</p>;\n}",
  "inefficientRendering_description": "In this example, ChildComponent will re-render every time the state in ParentComponent is updated, even if the changes are only related to 'count' and do not affect the props ChildComponent receives. This causes unnecessary re-renders of ChildComponent.",
  "efficientRendering_title": "Efficiency: Using React.memo, useMemo, and useCallback",
  "efficientRendering_solution": "Use React.memo to memorize the component and prevent unnecessary re-renders. Additionally, useMemo and useCallback can be used to avoid unnecessary recreation of values and functions on each render.",
  "efficientCode_example": "import React, { useState, useMemo, useCallback } from 'react';\n\nconst ChildComponent = React.memo(({ data }) => {\n  console.log('ChildComponent is rendering!');\n  return <p>{data}</p>;\n});\n\nfunction ParentComponent() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  const [text, setText] = useState('');\n\n  the handleTextChange = useCallback((e) => {\n    setText(e.target.value);\n  }, []);\n\n  the memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(text), [text]);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>\n      <input value={text} onChange={handleTextChange} />\n      <ChildComponent data={memoizedValue} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction computeExpensiveValue(value) {\n  console.log('Computing expensive value');\n  return `Computed: ${value}`;\n}",
  "efficientRendering_description": "In this enhanced example, ChildComponent only re-renders if the 'data' prop changes, thanks to React.memo. Furthermore, useCallback prevents the creation of a new function on each render, and useMemo ensures that 'computeExpensiveValue' is only recalculated when 'text' changes, thus reducing unnecessary workload in render cycles.",
  "stateManagement_title": "3.- Efficient State Management",
  "stateManagement_goal": "Managing state efficiently is crucial for maintaining the performance and readability of React applications. Manage local state only when necessary and avoid elevating state without justification.",
  "stateInefficiency_title": "Inefficiency in State Management",
  "stateInefficiency_problem": "Developers often elevate state more than necessary or use complex state management solutions when they are not needed, which can lead to excessive prop propagation and unnecessary re-renders.",
  "inefficientCode_example3": "function ParentComponent() {\n  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');\n  the [clicked, setClicked] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input value={inputValue} onChange={e => setInputValue(e.target.value)} />\n      <button onClick={() => setClicked(true)}>Click Me!</button>\n      <ChildComponent clicked={clicked} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ChildComponent({ clicked }) {\n  return <div>{clicked ? 'Clicked!' : 'Not clicked'}</div>;\n}",
  "stateInefficiency_description": "Here, ChildComponent only needs to know the state of 'clicked', but 'inputValue' is also managed at the same level, which may not be necessary and causes the ParentComponent to re-render also due to irrelevant changes for ChildComponent.",
  "stateEfficiency_title": "Efficiency in State Management",
  "stateEfficiency_solution": "Use local state within components that really need it and consider using Context API or Redux for global states, but always minimizing updates that do not affect the UI.",
  "efficientCode_example3": "function ParentComponent() {\n  the [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input value={inputValue} onChange={e => setInputValue(e.target.value)} />\n      <ChildComponent />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ChildComponent() {\n  the [clicked, setClicked] = useState(false);\n  return (\n    <button onClick={() => setClicked(true)}>\n      {clicked ? 'Clicked!' : 'Click me!'}\n    </button>\n  );\n}",
  "stateEfficiency_description": "In this improved design, ChildComponent manages its own 'clicked' state, freeing ParentComponent from unnecessary responsibility and preventing unnecessary re-renders when 'inputValue' changes.",
  "additionalStateTips_title": "Additional Recommendations",
  "contextAPI_usage": "Context API: Useful for states that are needed across many parts of the component tree but do not change frequently.",
  "reduxMobx_advice": "Redux/MobX: These libraries are powerful for managing complex and derived states in large applications, but they introduce additional complexity and possible inefficiencies if not used properly. Use well-designed and memorized selectors to extract state data and reduce re-renders.",
  "stateManagement_conclusion": "Managing state efficiently is key to optimizing both the performance and maintainability of React applications, avoiding unnecessary overhead and enhancing the user experience.",
  "lazyLoading_title": "4. Lazy Loading and Code Splitting",
  "lazyLoading_intro": "Lazy Loading and Code Splitting are essential techniques in modern React application development to optimize loading and performance. These techniques not only improve initial load speed but also efficiently manage resource utilization by loading only the necessary components or modules when needed.",
  "lazyLoading_definition": "Lazy Loading is an optimization technique that involves loading components or resources only when needed, for example, when a user accesses a specific part of the application. This reduces initial load time and memory usage, as not all components load at the same time.",
  "codeSplitting_definition": "Code Splitting is the process of dividing an application's code into multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime. React supports this technique natively through React.lazy() and Suspense, allowing you to define components that will load only when they are rendered.",
  "inefficientExample_title": "Example of Inefficiency Without Lazy Loading and Code Splitting",
  "inefficientExample_description": "Suppose you have a large application with several heavy components that are loaded in the main bundle, although only one of them is initially displayed to the user. This could significantly increase initial load time and negatively affect the user experience.",
  "inefficientExample_code": "function ParentComponent() {\n  the [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState('');\n  the [clicked, setClicked] = useState(false);\n\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <input value={inputValue} onChange={e => setInputValue(e.target.value)} />\n      <button onClick={() => setClicked(true)}>Click Me!</button>\n      <ChildComponent clicked={clicked} />\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n\nfunction ChildComponent({ clicked }) {\n  return <div>{clicked ? 'Clicked!' : 'Not clicked'}</div>;\n}",
  "efficientExample_title": "Example of Efficient Use of Lazy Loading with React.lazy and Suspense",
  "efficientExample_description": "React.lazy() allows you to define a component that will dynamically load only when needed. To handle the component's loading, use Suspense, which allows you to specify a fallback content (such as a loading indicator) while the component is being loaded.",
  "efficientExample_code": "import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';\n\nconst HeavyComponent1 = lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent1'));\nconst HeavyComponent2 = lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent2'));\nconst HeavyComponent3 = lazy(() => import('./HeavyComponent3'));\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <div>\n      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>\n        <HeavyComponent1 />\n      </Suspense>\n    </div>\n  );\n}",
  "bestPractices_title": "Best Practices",
  "bestPractices_details": "Analyze and measure: Use tools like Webpack Bundle Analyzer to identify which components or libraries are inflating your bundle. Dynamic route loading: In multi-route applications, use React.lazy to load route components only when the user navigates to them. Heavy components: Prioritize the use of Lazy Loading for resource-intensive components that are not necessary for the initial load.",
  "performanceImpact_description": "Properly implementing Lazy Loading and Code Splitting can significantly improve the performance of your React applications, making pages faster and more responsive, and enhancing the user experience, especially on devices with limited resources or slow connections.",
  "fragmentsUsage_title": "5.- Using Fragments to Reduce the DOM",
  "fragmentsConcept_description": "React.Fragment is a feature provided by React that allows developers to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM tree. This feature is particularly useful when you want to return multiple elements from a component without creating an additional wrapper element in the DOM, such as a <div>.",
  "fragmentsImportance_description": "In React, each component must return a single parent element. However, this restriction can lead to an unnecessary abundance of elements in the DOM, such as <div> or <span>, which are used only to satisfy this restriction. This can affect performance, especially in large applications, by increasing the size of the DOM and slowing down DOM manipulations.",

  "fragmentsBenefits_title": "Advantages of Using React.Fragment",
  "fragmentsBenefits_details": "Lower DOM Load: Fewer elements in the DOM mean a reduced load for rendering and updating the DOM, which is beneficial for performance, especially in complex interfaces. Maintenance of Semantically Correct HTML: Helps maintain the document structure consistent with HTML rules, avoiding rendering errors caused by incorrect nesting of elements.",
  "fragmentsConsiderations_title": "Side Effects and Considerations",
  "fragmentsConsiderations_details": "Debugging: One possible downside of using React.Fragment is that the elements it groups do not appear as nodes in browser development tools, which can make debugging a bit more complicated. Keys in Fragments: If you are mapping a list of components using React.Fragment, you will need to use <React.Fragment key={keyValue}> to assign keys. Short fragments <>...</> do not support keys, which can be limiting in certain use cases.",

  "intro": "In my life, I have touched on various labor sectors; I've been from the depths of Mexican mines, to selling solar energy on the streets of Dallas, Texas. I was another trader in the club 90, and also an organic machine logging thousands of serial numbers per day of airplane parts by hand in a warehouse in England. I always knew I wasn't at home.",

  "last_chance": "Having the mindset, but having to climb thousands and thousands of steps to get the hammer, something that seemed like the last chance. For me, that was learning to program, the discontent with the decisions I made when I did not recognize the supposed value of human time.",

  "motivation": "Where did my motivation come from? It's a question equivalent to where did matter come from. The universe and its behavior not understood by man, gives us the answer. Reality is mental, the power of thought moves the fractals of all universes, a place where energy is infinite in its infinities.",
  "philosophy": "Where order is in disorder and the command of thought materializes reality, it is so similar to programming, they are the same fundamentals, it is the structure of thought, the logical within the illogical.",
  "intro_title": "How We Got Here",

  "blogPostTitle": "Discovery and Transformation",
  "blogPostSubtitle": "A short story about what keeps me motivated",
  "introParagraph": "I started from zero, without having pursued a degree in programming; I had never seen a line of code. Perhaps in my childhood, thanks to a friend who made scripts to bot in a game called Tibia, was my only contact with scripts and automation, but I had never been in contact with a terminal.",
  "challengeParagraph": "Without knowing anything, I decided to start satisfying my curiosity. Some of my programmer friends told me it was too late, others told me I needed to complete a full degree, and yet others said I could easily surpass myself alone. So, I started with the basics. I looked for boot camps, but none convinced me; they seemed more like a scam where, if I managed to find a job, I would be sentencing myself to give them a portion of my salaries for the rest of my life. Also, the learning programs seemed convoluted and, beyond simple, extensive, boring, and complicated.",
  "technologyDiscovery": "I was aware that it would not be easy, but I started to investigate the most used technologies: CSS, JS, HTML, the triforce of web development. Later, I encountered Node.js, compilation environments, and from question to question, from why to why, I dug a well of questions and answers deeper each day.",
  "codingStart": "When I had a notion of certain tools, I began to write pseudocode on my own to try solving typical algorithm problems for interviews, but I had no idea what I was getting into.",
  "codingChallenges": "Soon I was solving problems using JavaScript without having the slightest command of the language, not really knowing where it came from or who compiled the language. Questions about the various levels of abstraction arose and answers were lacking when I touched certain strata of knowledge, but at least some doubts were satisfied.",
  "udemyExperience": "Later on, a friend gave me his Udemy account (I had neither job nor money at that time in my life, I was completely broke) and I began to solve the courses, first about Node execution environments. That's where I learned a bit about the principles of SOLID and architecture. When I felt more comfortable with certain tasks that I had replicated exactly as in the videos, I began to try creating my own user interfaces. CSS is complicated and tedious when you do not have well-structured ideas of how it works and what solutions it offers, or rather it is impossible to know how something works if you do not even know how to identify a problem due to lack of experience.",
  "learningHTMLCSS": "On the go, I learned HTML and CSS, but later had to learn to implement JavaScript, which I was somewhat afraid of because it was my great weakness. At that time, I had been programming in CSS and HTML for 6 months with a few fundamentals of JS, but I had to do it. I started creating simple components, imitating and understanding half of what those from Tailwind did. For this, I was using Figma, but when I had to give them functionality, that's when I had problems. I replicated almost all the components of Tailwind, from counters to presentation cards, but only up to there; I still did not have the macros to understand their implementation in larger projects and that was another great challenge.",
  "designLearning": "I started creating prototype websites that looked like haunted houses. I was aware of the design system, but I did not know the macros to be able to implement them with technologies such as CSS modules or Tailwind itself and had no experience in design. In addition to breaking my head with programming, I extensively researched the fundamentals of design, the history of design, the changes that have occurred and how they have emerged thanks to the technologies that the community has been implementing over time.",
  "projectFailures": "I failed in several personal projects, but I knew that watching videos and courses I would not learn at the speed I should. My failure and frustration at seeing errors after errors were what made me learn to investigate. I was also between a rock and a hard place due to my financial and personal situation; my situation at those moments gave me no motivation, it seemed the worst decision I had ever made. But I never give up, I fight for what I really want, and my pride is humble, but tough as the rock my father always taught me to be.",
  "firstWebApp": "At 9 months, I was already creating my first web application, currently deployed and belonging to a Mexican solar energy company. It had its database implemented, its APIs, REST, CRUD, protocols, providers, and much more. They were 16-hour days for several months of learning on my own, without certifications or courses or classes or absolutely any support except for a single friend who guided me among the fundamentals.",
  "reflectionOnJourney": "Today, in October 2024, it has been about 14 months since I started in this world and with what little I have created I feel that I have come too far. This is thanks to trying too hard, because no matter how much back pain my plastic chair caused me, I never gave up. I always knew there were people in the world who would have wanted to be in my place and all the little sacrifice I made was in the name of what they would have done too.",

The language was developed in just ten days and was initially called 'Mocha', then renamed to 'LiveScript', and finally to 'JavaScript', reflecting a marketing strategy to leverage the popularity of Java at the time. Despite its name, JavaScript is not directly related to Java.",
        "evolution": "Over time, JavaScript has become the backbone of the World Wide Web and has evolved significantly with the introduction of ECMAScript (ES), the technical standard for the language. ECMAScript has seen several versions, each adding more features and improvements, from ES3 in 1999 to ES6 (ECMAScript 2015), which introduced classes, modules, promises, and many other modern capabilities."

It was there that I began studying geopolitics, history, wars, and adversities that humanity has faced—not as naturally as we believe, but rather to maintain the structure of power and benefits for the few in the apparent interest of all."

          "I returned to Mexico to be close to my family because nothing compares to seeing what's most important to me day after day.",
          "I thought that beyond my future, it was my present that really mattered—to be close to the people who, at some point, will no longer be there. People who gave me love and life."

          "Since I set my career aside due to being a frustrated musician and a critic of the system with a fear of capitalist failure, I had to start from scratch several times.",

          "I attempted the nearly impossible path of trading, developing a kind of hyper-aware gambling addiction to risk. For two years of day trading, I managed to multiply my initial capital almost tenfold; however, my ambition was more consistent than a solid statistical method, and my mind and principles changed drastically. I sacrificed two years of my life and quite a few salaries, only to dissolve them in a matter of weeks. I didn’t want to see a trading account again for years. The next time I trade, it won’t be me personally; it will be a script to avoid the mistakes a human could make.",

          "",

          "The good thing about following that path is that I learned a lot about economics, finance, geoeconomics, banking systems, hard money, fiduciary systems, commodities, markets and their laws, and much more!",

          "Shortly after, realizing that energy is the core of the value humans perceive as effort (J), I went to learn about photovoltaic systems and how to sell them. If there is something difficult in this life, it's door-to-door sales. I never imagined I would become an expert in communication along the way. After knocking on over 15,000 doors, I could read certain traits that seemed universal in humans. After being locked in a warehouse all day, in a 5x5 room doing trading all night with the volatility of the lockdown, I was grateful to have spoken to so many people.",

          "Then I returned to Mexico to start a business close to my family, and I started programming because I thought it was too easy :) Many of my close friends had studied computer systems or mechatronics, so they were my guides and provided all the knowledge on a silver platter. I am very grateful to them, especially to Axel, a great teacher.",

          "99% of what you see was self-taught. Nobody ever gave me a problem to solve or even a question to answer; my mind was the problem, and the questions came from there—from errors in the console, from hunger, and from concern. I keep going, I keep learning, I don't stop.",

          "Algorithm problems, pseudocode, and JS—thinking, thinking, and thinking. Funny how naturally it came to me. Then HTML, easy; CSS, not so much.",

          "React was the cherry on top. Intermittently, I tried NoSQL before SQL. It was challenging, but I learned the hard way. I also managed to grasp Django, Ruby on Rails, and Laravel. A friend who is an expert in data, noticing my rapid progress, invited me to one of his projects, where I even got to work with Flask for Python.",

          "At this moment, I have about 12 effective months programming. I’ve spoken to several graduates in computer science, and it seems as though I went to school with aliens (:",

          "I want to reach the next level of learning; I want to work in large teams, to learn from those who know, to surround myself with real experts and prove to myself through them that I am good at this. I may not have the best resume, but every line of this project is dedicated to proving I can be of service to you.",

          "I am also the co-founder of a solar energy company in Mexico. However, to fulfill the goal of allowing all Mexicans to buy a piece of a solar park, rather than foreign companies with their financing and interest over the Mexican people, I have to give them a great application.",
